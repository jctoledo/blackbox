Physical designs and schematics for Active Wing.

## Current Status

This directory is reserved for future hardware contributions:

- PCB designs (KiCad or Eagle files)
- 3D-printable enclosures (STL files)
- Mounting brackets and hardware
- Cable harnesses and wiring guides
- Bill of Materials (BOM) spreadsheets

## Needed Contributions

We'd love help with:

### PCB Design
- Integrated ESP32 + IMU + GPS board
- Power management (12V input, voltage regulation)
- Compact form factor
- Through-hole version for easy assembly

### Enclosures
- 3D-printable case for dev boards
- Mounting options (velcro, screws, magnets)
- Protective design (dust, water, vibration)
- Cable management

### Mounting Solutions
- Universal vehicle mounts
- Roll cage clamps
- Dashboard mounts
- Adhesive solutions for different surfaces

### Documentation
- Assembly instructions with photos
- Wiring diagrams (Fritzing or similar)
- Recommended sourcing (where to buy parts)
- Testing procedures
