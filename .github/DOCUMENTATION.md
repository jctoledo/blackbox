## Documentation Philosophy

We maintain **one source of truth** for each type of information:

- **README.md** - What the project does, quick start, high-level overview
- **CLAUDE.md** - Deep technical details, architecture, how things work
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How to contribute + Code of Conduct
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
- **docs/FAQ.md** - Common questions and troubleshooting
- **docs/SECURITY.md** - Security policy

If you find duplicate information, please consolidate it!
